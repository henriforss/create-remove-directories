# Create and remove directories

Trying out Node.js File System.

createDirs.js asks for a directory name and creates a new directory, if there is no directory with that name.

removeDirs.js removes all empty directories in current path.

This package (?) is executable with npx:

`npx git@github.com:henriforss/create-remove-directories.git`
